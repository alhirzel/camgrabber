Downloads webcams according to sunrise/sunset times

Very, very beta!

My plan is to make a foreground daemon that can be tucked away behind
tmux/screen and forgotten about. Right now I really need to add the following
features:

 [ ] automatically cycle the queue (right now you will need to CTRL+C every day)
 [ ] really support multiple webcams
 [ ] add events so that you can compile .jpg -> .mpg and upload to YouTube daily
